## mlog

the mlog is multi-level logger based on go std log. It is:

* Simple
* Easy to use
* Easy to extend a new logger like color log, syslog, rolling file log ...

NOTHING ELSE

```
package main

import (
	"log"
	"os"

	"github.com/ccpaging/log/mlog"
)

var logger = mlog.New(os.Stdout, "main: ", log.LstdFlags)

func main() {
	logger.Debugln("This is Debug")
	logger.Infoln("This is Info")
}
```
